# AbletonAutoColor
Automatic Color Assignment Based On Name In Ableton Live

for Mac or Windows (not tested on Ableton linux yet)

4 Steps:
1. go to /Users/{your_username}/Music/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts/
2. create folder titled ColorChanger
3. download files to this folder
4. select ColorChanger in Link|Tempo|Midi tab in Ableton, and make sure input and output are set to 'None'

Only tested on Ableton 11, but should work for any Abletons if they have python3 natively and can use control surfaces
Enjoy the python functionality native to Ableton Live which makes this possible!

limitations:
name change event is only registered when a new track is made or a new device is clicked on
